“Asset Repository Website”

Use this prompt in Replit, Cursor, Windsurf, or any agent-based coding environment.

Copy–paste this whole thing:

PROMPT START

You are an AI coding agent.
Build a complete full-stack web application using React + TypeScript (frontend) and Supabase (backend).

The project is an Asset Repository Website — essentially a lightweight “front-end for a repo” with the following capabilities:

1. Core Features
1.1 Upload + Embed Assets

Users must be able to:

Upload video files → stored in Supabase storage → auto-generate a playable video element on the page.

Submit video links (YouTube/Vimeo/etc.) → embed them directly with an iframe.

Upload audio files → stored in Supabase storage → create an audio player on the page.

Add general links (URLs to PDFs, external sites, GitHub repos, etc.) → render as clickable assets.

All assets must be typed, stored, and retrievable.

2. Multiple-Choice Quiz Uploader

There must be an interface where users can:

Upload a .json file containing multiple-choice questions + answers

The system should validate the structure

Store it in Supabase under a quizzes table with fields:
id, title, description, json, created_at

Provide a simple viewer UI to list and open stored quizzes.

3. UX / Layout

A clean and simple layout:

A light gray left sidebar (fixed) for navigation

Main content area on the right

Sidebar items:

Dashboard (list all assets)

Upload Asset

Upload Quiz

View Quizzes

Settings (placeholder)

No fancy styling required — TailwindCSS or simple CSS modules.

4. Architecture Requirements

Use a clean DDD-ish structure:

Domain Layer

Define TypeScript types / interfaces for:

VideoAsset

AudioAsset

LinkAsset

QuizDocument

Application Layer

Create reusable service functions:

uploadVideo(file)

uploadAudio(file)

uploadQuiz(json)

saveLink(url)

listAssets()

listQuizzes()

Infrastructure Layer

Implement:

Supabase client

Storage adapters (upload to buckets)

Database adapters (CRUD functions)

Presentation Layer

Screens & components:

Sidebar

AssetList

AssetUploader

QuizUploader

QuizList

QuizViewer

Routing using React Router.

5. Database Schema (Supabase)

Create:

assets table
id (uuid)
type (text: 'video_file' | 'video_link' | 'audio_file' | 'link')
url (text)
metadata (jsonb)
created_at (timestamp)

quizzes table
id (uuid)
title (text)
description (text)
json (jsonb)
created_at (timestamp)

Storage Buckets

videos

audios

other

6. Deliverables

Generate:

Full project folder structure

All frontend components

All service files

Supabase schema SQL

Instructions on running locally + environment variables

At least one sample quiz JSON

At least one example asset document in the database

Make sure the app runs immediately after installation.
